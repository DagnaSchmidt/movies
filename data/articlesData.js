                'Based on historical events, the series tells the story of Queen Elizabeth II and the political and personal fortunes that shaped her reign. With the new decade of the 1990s, the royal family faces perhaps the greatest challenge to date; the public is openly questioning their role in Britain.',
                'This turbulent decade has been well documented and presented by journalists, biographers and historians. As Elizabeth Debicki, who plays the role of Princess Diana, explains: "It is an amazing experience to play these characters because season five of The Crown had the most visual references [to reality]. an hour-long news cycle. So we have access to a tremendous amount of content. "',
                "Dominic West (Prince Charles) says of the new cast: 'I think people understand the need to change it every two seasons. [Role-playing] is not an imitation, it is summoning a character.' Imelda Staunton (Queen Elizabeth II) hopes that, like her character, she has fulfilled her duty to the audience: 'I hope the audience enjoys my role. I've already played it and I can't help it!'"
